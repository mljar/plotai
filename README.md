## Important secutiry risk

The PlotAI executes code from LLM. It is using `exec()` function for this. 

I commented out the `exec()` function in file `plotai/code/executor.py`. If you understand the security risks you need to remove comment to use the package.

# PlotAI 🎨🤖 

The easiest way to create plots in Python and Matplotlib. The `plotai` is using LLM to generate code and plots.

The idea:
1. User provides input DataFrame and prompt.
2. The `PlotAI` constructs a prompt for LLM, which contains the first 5 rows of DataFrame and the user's prompt and asks for Python code as output.
3. Returned Python code is executed, and the plot is displayed.

The simplest possible API for plotting:
```python
# import packages
import pandas as pd
from plotai import PlotAI
# create some data
df = pd.DataFrame({"x":[1,2,3], "y": [4,5,6]})
# do a plot
plot = PlotAI(df)
plot.make("scatter plot")
```

The `PlotAI` class has only one method, `make()`.

It works in Python scripts and in notebooks (Jupyter, Colab, VS Code).

## 🚀 Get started

Install `plotai` package:

```bash
pip install plotai
```

Create `.env` file with the OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

You can also pass the OpenAI API key in Python:

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-key-here"
```

Import `plotai` and make plots:

```python
# import PlotAI
from plotai import PlotAI

# create PlotAI object, pass pandas DataFrame as an argument
plot = PlotAI(df)

# make a plot, just tell what you want
plot.make("make a scatter plot")
```

By default the library will use '*gpt-3.5-turbo*'. You can use different OpenAI models:

```python
# import PlotAI
from plotai import PlotAI

# create PlotAI object, pass pandas DataFrame as an argument
plot = PlotAI(df, model_version="gpt-4")

# make a plot, just tell what you want
plot.make("make a scatter plot")
```

We look forward to connecting with you and hearing your thoughts, ideas, and experiences with PlotAI. Let's explore the future of AI together!

## ⚠️ Limitations

PlotAI is in very experimental form, below are some limitations:
- PlotAI is using OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5-turbo for completions, it will be nice to extend to other LLMs.
- PlotAI is sending 5 first rows from your DataFrame to OpenAI ChatGPT. If you have sensitive data, please remove/encode it before passing to `PlotAI`.
- PlotAI is executing Python code returned by LLM, it can be dangerous and unsafe. It would be nice to have the option to accept the response code before execution.

## Convert Python Notebooks to web applications 📓 -> 🌐

We are working on framework [Mercury](https://github.com/mljar/mercury) for sharing Python notebooks as interactive web applications. The framework is open source. We also working on a service for [one-click deployment of Python notebooks](https://runmercury.com/). You can check [Python notebooks integrations on our website](https://runmercury.com/use/). 

All the best!
